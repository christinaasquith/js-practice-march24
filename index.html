    <p><center>In March 2021, journalist Chea Evans was pressured to resign from the Charlotte News. Four members of the board resigned in protest after other board members refused to offer her her job back. Dozens of members of the Charlotte community spoke out in protest. This letter is for them remaining members of the Charlotte News board.</center></p>


<h1><center>Letter on behalf of Chea Evans</center></h1>

<p>Dear members of the board of The Charlotte News,</p>
    <p>  We are residents of Charlotte and, first, want to thank you for your volunteer work leading and supporting the Charlotte News. The paper has been a vital source of information and, more than that, a key institution strengthening our sense of community. 
        <p>Because the News is so important to us, we feel the need to express our deep concern and puzzlement over recent events. Chea Evans has been a crucial voice these past years. She has reported with clarity, fairness, and depth on every major issue our community has faced. We feel she has made Charlotte far stronger by arming its citizens with the information they need to make crucial decisions. 
            </p>
            <p>She has done this without fear or favor. </p>
            <p>The information about her separation from the News has been both confusing and distressing. She has made clear that she is happy to continue to report on our community and we strongly suggest that you reinstate her immediately. This decision was made abruptly and in a way that led several board members to resign in protest. But we have faith that all sides can come to a mutually beneficial agreement while maintaining the integrity of the news we have come to expect. </p>
            
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> We respectfully request the following: - Reinstate Chea Evans immediately.</li> 
                        <li> - Commit, publicly, to an editorial policy of covering all key issues of our community fearlessly and fairly.</li>
                        <li> - Establish a policy of editorial independence for the journalists who work at the News. This would mean that the publisher and board members will not interfere with editorial decision-making. In addition, they will reveal conflicts of interest regarding any stories the News might cover. </li>
                        <li>- Ensure that no reporter or editor of the News can be fired, pressured to resign, or otherwise forced to make a decision against their free will for their editorial work.</li>
                        <li> - Establish a community advisory board that can offer guidance, suggestions, and express concerns, about coverage at the paper. Such a board would not have any voting authority, but would ensure the board never, again, make decisions so at odds with the interests of the community.</li></ul>
                            
                            <br>
                        <p>  We do want to emphasize that we are writing this note because of our love of the Charlotte News and our strong commitment to its continued existence. We believe that this episode can become the greatest one in the history of the News: establishing the paper on a firm base, solidifying its support in the community. We are eager to join you in this effort. However, we fear that this moment could have the opposite impact. </p>
                        <p>If you ignore the concerns of the community and shy away from fearless and fair coverage, you will weaken the paper, possibly permanently. But we have high hopes that you will all make the right choice. We do hope you will view this letter in the supportive way in which it is meant. Every person signing below is eager to help you strengthen The Charlotte News.</p>

                        <br>
